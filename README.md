# I Can Do Whatever I Want license

The **I Can Do Whatever I Want** license, **ICDWIWL**, or simply the **Cry About It** license, is a software license that is primarily meant for use with projects that modify (or use modified versions of) other projects, especially those that would not otherwise permit their usage in such projects. It grants the licenser full control over their copy of the data (defined as "bytes or other information") with zero consequences or legal liabilities. It is useful for projects which use, for example, leaked source code of other projects in order to improve their own.

To view the license, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

## Best practices

I recommend hosting any project that uses this license for its intended purpose with a service that is difficult to be taken down by private entities, for example a TOR onion site. This is because the majority of centralised hosting services reserve the right to delete anything from their platform for any reason or no reason at all, with no regard for licensing. This license is intended to save you from being sued, not from private censorship.

## FAQ

### Is this serious/real?

Absolutely, 100%. This license is as serious/real as any other software license.

### Is this legally binding/will this hold up in court?

Again, yes. There is nothing stopping this from being completely valid in any court of law that recognises software licenses.
